			<p>
				While classes do take up a lot of my time I participate in an event called Big Event at Texas A&M every year with my organization MSA (Mexican Student Association). 
				Big Event is a day long event where a large amount of the student body voluntarily takes on different tasks in helping the community which usually involves some kind of work outside. 
				Last year my group and I helped an elderly couple fix up their yard by pulling weeds, raking and shoveling up old dry dirt and leaves and replacing it with fresh dirt. 
				They had planned on selling their home and needed it to be presentable.

			<p>
				While it may not impact the entire community, when I am at home I am always either working or assisting my family in some form or fashion which usually involves caring for my younger siblings or relatives. 
				I help however I can by picking up food, taking them to sport practices, or picking them up from and dropping them off at school.
