			<h3>
				Upbringing and Highschool 
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
				Originally from San Antonio, Texas, my journey with computer science began when I was 16 years old and I took an AP Computer Science course at William J. Brennan Highschool my junior year.
				I began my journey coding in Java and was exposed to concepts such as object oriented programming, inheritence, and ended with a GUI interface project which was a small game. 
				I found coding very stimulating and was able to stay on a project or assignment for several hours at a time if uninterrupted.
				I then and still to this day would always rather be coding than doing work in any other classes. 
				This was the point where I knew this is what I wanted to be doing as a career.
				The senior year I applied to several different universities, Texas A&M being one of them.

			<h3>
				College
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
				I was accepted into the Texas A&M Engineering Program at Galveston where I took my introductory courses for my freshman year and then transferred to Texas A&M College Station. 
				Here I took my first college level computer science courses and while the transition was a little rough in the beginning, I was soon able to find a good study and day routine.
				I had a lot of help from the online sources<u><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target = "_blank">Stack Overflow</a></u>
				<u><a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/" target = "_blank">C++,</a></u>&
				<u><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target = "_blank">Hacker Rank</a></u>
				This allowed me to reach my position now as a senior Computer Science and Engineering student graduating in December 2020. 
				After which I am very eager to join the workforce and put all the knowledge I've built up over these past 6 years to valuable work.

			<h3>
				Future Goals and Aspirations
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
				I have future goals of becoming a Data Scientist with a background in security. 
				After graduation I plan on continuing my education by completing some industry certifications such as the Cisco Certified Network Associate certification and the Offensive Security Certified Professional certification in addition to their prerequisites. 
				After a few years in the industry I plan on returning to college to pursue a Master's degree in Cyber Security at the University of Texas at San Antonio. 
				Many years from now I plan on pursuing my PHD and completing it before I reach the age of 40.
