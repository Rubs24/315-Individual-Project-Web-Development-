				<u><a target = "blank" href = "https://github.com/Rubs24/313-Simple-Linux-Shell" >Simple Linux Shell</a></u>
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
				This is a simple linux shell designed to run simple commands, implement IO redirections, and implement piping. I did this Fall 2019 semester in my intro to computer systems course. It's written in C++ and allowed me to learn the Linux environment as well as commands and Shell design. Above is the link to the code in GitHub.

			</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
				This entire website was fully developed by me. This was a project for my CSCE 315 programming studio class and was a self taught assigment which involved me learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the first time. Above is the GitHub link to my code.

				Vision and Aspirations
			</h2>
			<p>
				A lot of the public has lost confidence in a company's ability to secure a database that's carrying their personal and sensitive information. 
				News stories come out regularly about security breaches. 
				These stories are giving the public the perception that these successful attacks are commonplace. 
				When a business is breached, customer confidence goes down, sales go down, current customers leave, and business can be stopped completely until all the damage is undone, if it can be. 
				I want to be able to help businesses avoid this catastrophic scenario by evaluating their network infrastructure, how the software they are using was developed, and provide penetration testing to see if their system can be breached from the outside. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I plan on contributing to the advancement of data and information security. 
				The first part of my goal is nearly complete here at Texas A&M and I am now familiar with the development and analysis of a variety of software and hardware. 
				I plan to further my education with both education in the form of a Master's degree in Cyber Security combined with some two well known certifications the 
				Cisco Certified Network Associate<u><a  href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/entry/ccent.html" target = "_blank">(CCNA)</a></u>
				and Offensive Security Certified Professional<u><a href="https://www.kali.org/penetration-testing-with-kali-linux/" target = "_blank">(OSCP)</u></a>and their respective prerequisites. 
				These certifications are related to both networking and penetration testing respectively and will allow me to better understand the applications of my newfound knowledge.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				In my personal experience knowing more about one of these topics will give you a better understanding of the other. 
				For instance, if you are very familiar with networking infrastructure and software development, then you will have a better idea of how to test for security breaches for a customer. 
				Itâ€™s for this reason I have selected these specific areas to study. 
				They compliment each other very well and all together create a powerful and valuable understanding that would be very beneficial to any employer.
